### Decentralized (DEX) Exchanges

We are pleased to announce the ability to trade Coval on a few Decentralized exchanges.

### Top 100 Centralized Exchange (liquidity)

Since our departure from Bittrex, we have been focusing on finding exchanges to list the new ERC20 (Ethereum based) Coval token. This endevor has exposed that listing fee's range from $10,000 to $500,000 for listings on any of the top 100 exchanges.

After contacting, negotiating and evaluating a few hundred exchanges, We have decided that [Stex](https://app.stex.com?ref=64697954) would be the best exchange for the cost. 

Stex has charged 1 BTC for listing Coval on their exchange. We have accepted their terms and have paid. Our listing on [Stex](https://app.stex.com?ref=64697954) is imminent and will be announced as soon as it becomes live.  

The listing fees are a considerable barrier of entry for projects who are in buidl mode or otherwise bootstrapped.

### P2P / OTC Exchanges

- [Airswap](https://trader.airswap.io/)

Airswap.io allows for a different kind of exchange. With airswap, you can create a maker or taker order. Once the order is created you are presented with a URL that can be placed in a chat, an email, forum or otherwise shared with people. Coval has been tested with Airswap and a deeper integration is being created to enable the creation and sharing of these airswap orders over telegram. Feel free to experiment with Airswap. Once integration is complete we will announce it's release. 

### New Telegram channels

We have created a few new official telegram channels.....
